Hello! In this project, I developed a task management application in the to-do list style using ReactJS as part of the ReactJS track challenge from Rocketseat.

## About the Project
The main objective of this project was to apply the most important concepts of ReactJS and learn new concepts that will be useful in future applications. The challenge consisted of creating an application that allowed:

+ Add a new task
+ Check and uncheck a task as completed
+ Remove a task from the list
+ Show the progress of task completion
+ To achieve these goals, it was necessary to review and apply concepts such as states, immutability of state, lists and keys in ReactJS, properties, and componentization.

## How it Works
The application has a simple interface, where it is possible to add a new task through an input field. Each added task is displayed in the list with the option to check/uncheck as completed and delete the task.

In addition, the application shows the progress of task completion, indicating how many tasks have been created and how many have been completed.

## Next Steps
This project represents just the beginning of my learning journey in ReactJS. I plan to continue exploring more concepts and improving my skills to develop increasingly complex and robust applications.

If you have any suggestions or feedback about the project, I'd love to hear it! ðŸ˜Š
